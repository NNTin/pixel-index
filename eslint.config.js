 * to say the two services holding every request handler, every SQL query and
 * every browser were the parts nobody linted. Four sibling configs would have
 * drifted the same way the four tsconfigs did (see tsconfig.strict.json), so
 * this is deliberately a single file with per-area overrides rather than a
 * shared preset each workspace re-exports.
 *
 * ESLint 10 resolves the config from the linted file upward, so `eslint .` from
 * a workspace directory finds this file and lints only that workspace — the
 * per-workspace `lint` scripts stay useful without a config of their own.
 *
 * The bar is `strictTypeChecked` + `stylisticTypeChecked` in full, minus the
 * exceptions below. It used to be `recommendedTypeChecked` plus a hand-picked
 * list of ten extra rules, which had two problems: a rule the presets add in a
 * future typescript-eslint release lands nowhere, and three rules were declined
 * for their report counts rather than for anything about the rules. Measured
 * before the switch, 35 of the rules the two presets add were already at zero
 * here — so the allow-list was mostly recording work already done.
