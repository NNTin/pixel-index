 * intended URL and bounces them to the real app root; `index.html`'s own
 * inline script (see index.html) restores it via `history.replaceState`
 * before React Router mounts, so the visitor lands on the page they actually
 * asked for. Two-file version of https://github.com/rafgraph/spa-github-pages
 * — there is no nested path-segment stripping to get right here because the
 * whole intended URL round-trips through sessionStorage, not just a suffix.
 *
 * A no-op on Vercel and local dev: they DO have rewrite rules (or don't need
 * any), so this 404.html is simply never requested there.

 * The manifest is no longer committed to the branch. It lives beside the PNGs

 * things follow, all of them the point:
 *
 * - **Nothing enters git.** No manifest in the PR diff, and none on `main` after
 *   a merge, so production cannot inherit one.
 * - **A production build physically cannot have the file.** The runtime already
 *   treats a missing manifest as "no override", so the guard is the absence of
 *   the file rather than a flag someone could get wrong.
 * - **Visitors never hotlink `raw.githubusercontent.com`.** The images are
 *   downloaded once per build and served same-origin, off the same CDN as the
 *   rest of the site.
 *
 * Keyed on the pinned commit, so a preview of an unrelated branch asks for a
 * render set that was never published and gets a 404. Every failure here is
 * silent and means "no override" — the safe direction.
